## Notes

It mainly took me a while to figure out how to properly submit the project, since my knowledge of GitHub (and most of HTML, CSS, & JS) has been kind of foggy after not using them for a while. It did feel refreshing completing a project like this as it reminded me of why I did enjoy coding (specifically Frontend Development) so much.
